# Full Stack Project - Node.js & React

This project is a full-stack web application built using **Node.js** for the backend and **React** for the frontend. It follows the guidelines provided while incorporating additional features that enhance functionality, security, and usability.

##  Project Overview
This application is based on the final project theme and includes:
- A **React-based frontend (FE)** with a structured component-based architecture.
- A **Node.js-based backend (BE)** using Express.js to handle API requests.
- A **MySQL database (DB)** to store user and application data.
- Secure **authentication and role-based access control**.
- Form validation for user inputs to ensure data integrity.

##  Features
###  Backend (BE)
- Developed with **Node.js** and **Express.js**.
- Uses **MySQL** for persistent storage.
- Implements **RESTful API routes** for CRUD operations.
- Includes authentication with **hashed passwords**.
- Role-based access control for users and administrators.
- Uses **router modules** for better structure and maintainability.

###  Frontend (FE)
- Developed with **React** using a modular component structure.
- Uses **react-router-dom** for navigation.
- Implements **form validation** for user inputs.
- Follows accessibility and responsive design principles.
- Uses **React Hooks** for state management.
- Data fetching is handled with **Axios**.

###  Database (DB)
- Implemented with **MySQL**.
- Contains at least **three tables**, including:
  - Users table (with hashed passwords).
  - Project-specific data.
  - Additional data table for extended functionality.
- Preloaded with sample data.

##  Additional Enhancements
Beyond the basic requirements, the following improvements were made:
- **Enhanced Security**: Additional validation and sanitization of user inputs.
- **Error Handling**: Implemented structured error messages for better debugging.
- **Session Management**: Users remain authenticated across sessions.
- **Modularization**: Code is split into meaningful files for maintainability.
- **Extended User Role Management**: Admins have exclusive access to certain operations.
